Hi, this is Songtao. I'm currently a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Penn State. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science from Fudan University.

My research focuses on scalable and efficient discrete generative modeling, with an emphasis on developing algorithms that reduce inference cost and solve diverse problems across domains such as language.

**I am on the job market for 2025-2026!**

## Selected Publications and Preprints    
**\* denotes equal contribution (first, second, or senior)**

Since several people asked about the contributions of my paper, I have listed contributions under the selected publications.

* [Multi-Head Low-Rank Attention](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W6Vm-urga96Hl4R17qq9A0f3mOQ5m5Fz/view?usp=share_link)

  [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02066) [[Code]](https://github.com/SongtaoLiu0823/CREBM)

  I led all technical aspects of the paper—including the core ideas, coding, experiments, and writing. HD proposed presenting the work through the lens of residual energy–based models. YZ supplied compute resources for rebuttal-period experiments.

* [FusionRetro: Molecule Representation Fusion via In-Context Learning for Retrosynthetic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15315)  
  <b><u>Songtao Liu</u></b>, Zhengkai Tu\*, Minkai Xu\*, Zuobai Zhang\*, Lu Lin, Rex Ying, Jian Tang, Peilin Zhao, Dinghao Wu
